start with abstracts.

I'm working with a set of 10 abstracts that I downloaded from

make sure that he graded it.
</font></b></p>


<p><b><font color="red">Specific comments for each abstract can be
      found under each abstract.  For this exercise, I'll try to
      identify a point for each abstract.  Ideally, the abstract would
      lead with a topic sentence that introduces the point, and end
      with a concluding sentence that summarizes the point.  The body
      of the abstract should stay on message.
</font></b></p>

<p><b><font color="red">As for the content, as mentioned in class, I
      was hoping that the point would be a greater appreciation of
      resources (such as WordNet).  Unsupervised statistics on corpora
      (such as PMI and Word2vec) are great in so far as they go, but
      don't expect unsupervised methods to do everything.  However,
      many students chose to focus more on what's hot (unsupervised
      statistics) and less on what I was hoping to discuss (resources).
</font></b></p>


<p><b><font color="red">Let me start with three abstracts where it is
      relatively easy to find the point, and both the topic sentence
      and the concluding sentence are on message.  Most (7 out of 10)
      abstracts didn't do that.

This survey paper introduces the nuance of the hand-crafted lexical
resource (HCLR) WordNet and argues for the continued place of HCLR's
in natural language processing research despite preliminary successes
of unsupervised, machine-generated resources such as word embeddings.
The power of HCLR's lies not only in their innate utility but in their
position as a ground-truth in research.  We demonstrate that HCLR's
still outperform machine-generated resources on several tasks, as well
as unite other research goals as a common baseline resource against
which all developments can be compared.  Additionally, HCLR's are
still state-of-the-art in interpretability and we outline possible
directions for using HCLR's to help interpret the outputs of other
systems.
<p><b><font color="red">Point: Resources (HCLR) have two advantages over
      embeddings: (1) performance, and (2) interpretability.  Both the
      topic sentence and the concluding sentence are on point (unlike
      most of the other abstracts below).  Very nice!

The success of recent neural-network-based approaches to classic NLP
tasks (e.g., machine translation, dependency parsing, syntactic
parsing, and sentiment analysis) has given rise to a "throw it into a
bigger neural net" attitude towards problem solving within the
field. In this sense, lexicography can be seen as a case-in-point:
rather than viewing lexicographic tasks as pipelines of
meticulously-tuned compartmental modules requiring insights from
linguists (the philosophy behind projects like WordNet, FrameNet,
PropBank, and innumerable hand-tagged corpora), "end-to-end" models
wherein only the input and output are required and neurons do the rest
are now in vogue. In this survey, we will explore both the
lexicography and "deep NLP" literature, with an emphasis on the
shortcomings of neural approaches (e.g., lack of interpretability) and
especially the "elephant in the room" -- namely, that behind the
"magic" of neural-net approaches to these tasks lies the human
linguistic labor necessary to obtain high-quality training and test
data.

<p><b><font color="red">Point: A criticism of "Deep NLP" on two grounds: (1) lack of interpretability,
      and (2) attributing too much success to "magic" and failing to acknowledge the contribution of human judgment in various important steps such as the preparation of test and training data.
Both the topic sentence and the concluding sentence are n point.  Very nice!

Internet has changed how people collaborate in word embedding research
and natural language processing in general.  During the early days of
word embedding research, there were no annotated datasets, and thus a
select few groups of people received funds to create annotated
datasets.  WordNet and FrameNet are two examples.  Nowadays it has
become relatively easy to distribute human labor efforts through using
crowdsourcing systems, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk to generate
annotated data sets required for natural language processing research.
Moreover, this trend hasn't just occurred only on data, but also the
tools required for performing natural language processing research.
Open sourcing language toolkits such as NLTK and releasing pretrained
language models, such as Word2Vec have made performing natural
language processing tasks more accessible.
<p><b><font color="red"> Point: Technology has changed collaboration.
      The topic sentence and the conclusion are both on point.  I'm
      concerned about technical correctness.  In fact, there were
      quite a few annotated resources before WordNet (such as the
      Brown Corpus).  While I may disagree with some of the facts, it
      is still nice to see an argument where it is relatively easy to
      connect the dots between the topic sentence and the concluding
      sentence and the point.

<p><b><font color="red">The seven abstracts below don't do what the two
      abstracts above do.  That is, in the seven abstracts below, I found it
      hard to connect the dots between the topic sentence and the
      concluding sentence and the point.

<p><b><font color="red">
A common (but not good) practice is to end with
a discussion of future work.  The last three abstracts below do that.

Automation is increasingly making our lives easier, but is it actually
making the job of lexicographers harder? Are there certain natural
language processing tasks, such as word sense disambiguation, that
will always be left to humans? Gregory Grefenstette predicted in 1998
that automation would completely eliminate the need for human
lexicographers. Progress like Yarowsky's in 1995, on an unsupervised
word sense disambiguation algorithm, supports this view. On the other
hand, Rundell and Kilgarriff went on to produce work suggesting the
opposite -- that automation would instead make lexicographers' jobs
more complicated while automating some of the drudgery. This survey
paper sides with Rundell, as studies published since Grefenstetteâ€™s
have shown the many challenges involved in automating dictionary
creation and word sense disambiguation. Some overarching advancements,
such as the "One sense per discourse" rule developed by Gale, Church,
and Yarowsky, have helped refine machines' ability to disambiguate
word sense. Nonetheless, a recent experiment in automating
lexicography to varying degrees (the Solvene Lexical Database)
concluded that automated lexicographical procedures are very useful,
but only because they facilitate the work of human lexicographers by
automating tedious tasks.
<p><b><font color="red">Point: Automation actually makes lexicography
      easier.  I really liked the way that this abstract started out,
      and the fact that it demonstrated a command of the literature
      that goes well beyond the assigned papers (though I worry that
      some of the references may be a bit off message).  I'm concerned
      that the set up leaves the reader a bit unsure where the
      argument is going.  And more seriously, the abstract ends
      without an obvious concluding sentence that clearly states the
      take-away message.  The abstract would be stronger if there was
      one more sentence such as: In short, we conclude that automation
      actually makes lexicography easier, despite various arguments
      that have been made elsewhere to the contrary.

Linguists classify words on the basis of their co-occurrence with
other words. With computation facilities, automatic methods such as
association ratio can be used to deal with large-scale corpora. Based
on the concept of mutual information, association ratio is able to
find interesting language patterns, not only noun/noun relationships,
but also subject/verb/object and other lexico-syntactic relationships
between words. The adjustable window size parameter in association
ratio allows it to reveal language phenomena of different
scales. Although association ratio takes only distributional evidence
into account and the measure is superficial without preprocesses, it
can be applied in a systematic way over large body of material because
of its consistency and productivity. In lexicography, association
ratio can be used to indicate the association of words which are
strong enough to be important but not so strong to pop out in a
concordance, and it provide a powerful set of suggestions to the
lexicographer in choosing a set of semantic tags. Association ratio
could be an important tool to aid the lexicographer.

<p><b><font color="red"> Point: Summary of my PMI paper.  If the real
      point is the final sentence (usefulness of association ratio),
      then the topic sentence doesn't exactly introduce that point.
      Moreover, the topic sentence isn't correct.  Many linguists
      (such as Chomsky) object to the use of distributional evidence,
      largely as a reaction to his thesis adviser (Harris).  Some
      linguists (like Firth and Harris) classify words on the basis of
      distribution, and some don't.

We are going to compare wordnet and word2vec major on their own
function and the similarity computation between words.  First, we
introduce the rise of new type encyclopedias like Wiki and Wordnet.
We introduce when and how word2vec is proposed and whatâ€™s the
intuition of building word2vec.  Next, we discuss the word
association, and the similarity computation of both wordnet and
word2vec.  Several experiments from different aspects are done for
evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of wordnet and word2vec
similarity computation.  At last, we have conclusion that word2vec is
a very popular tool using in NLP which use numeric vector to represent
a word while wordnet is more a kind of very powerful E-dictionary.
Whether to choose wordnet or word2vec depends on the task you are
going to do.
<p><b><font color="red"> Point: comparison of wordnet and word2vec.
      Conclusion: one is better for some apps and the other is better
      for other apps.  If the conclusion is the point, it should be
      possible to rewrite the topic sentence to make it a bit clearer
      where the argument is going.  The discussion of encyclopedias
      seems to be a bit off message.

Understanding the word associations that are formed in the mind is
important to understand the way human acquire language throughout a
lifetime of learning. Word associations are suggested as the mirror of
the conceptual connection model in human mind. Therefore, natural
language processing system focused on the use of words association to
implement the neural network. For example, kana-kanji conversion is a
Japanese standard input method, which is based on the set of Kanji
characters share the same phonetic sound. The use of the associative
functionality of neural network is to avoid the ambiguity of the
homonym selection among abundance of homonyms. One of the advantage of
the associative functionality is enabled word preference of user been
reflected in the network. The result of associative functionality
could be benefit for lexicographer.
<p><b><font color="red"> Point: Advocate the use of word associations
      as a theory of langauge acquisition.  The topic sentence is on
      point but the concluding sentence is not.  The discussionof
      kana-kanji conversion is interesting, but it isn't clear how
      that connects to the point, or the topic sentence or the
      concluding sentence.
</font></b></p>
</p><p>  The last three abstracts end with future work.  Ending
      with future work isn't great, not only because it makes it
      harder for the reader to figure out what the point is, but also
      because it can come across as an argument against the point.  If
      one feels a need to mention future work, it is better to frame
      it as suggestions for how the reader can follow up (and join in
      on the fun).

With the coming of information age, not only dictionaries became
digital, the methods for building lexical resources were also
experiencing a significant change. This survey focuses on the
transition of lexicography during the recent decades. In this survey,
we discuss how lexicographers use computational aids to build
lexicons, how non-experts collaborate and contribute to scientific and
linguistic resources, and how can computers expand and create lexicons
automatically. We also explore some potential future trends in
building multilingual lexicon and large-scale lexical resources.
<p><b><font color="red"> Point: A survey of how technology has changed
      the way that dictionaries are being constructed.  The topic
      sentence is on message.  It is common to end with future work
      rather than a conclusion that drives home the point.

Given the tremendous and growing amount of text data, automation of
various tasks in the field of NLP allows field professionals to
incorporate more data into their work at a faster pace. One such task
is building lexical semantic resources for words, once done by humans
by hand, and one of the current methods for modeling semantic and
syntactic relationship between words is word embedding. There are
multiple methods for generating word embeddings, including skip-gram
negative sampling, matrix factorization, and point-wise mutual
information, and among the more cited resources of lexicographical
information are tools like word2vec, GloVe, and a human-curated
lexical database WordNet. Because a notion that a word's meaning can
be derived "from the company it keeps" a popular one in NLP, which
words make up the given word's company is important. In this survey we
will examine the literature comparing the outputs of several popular
word embedding tools, and discussing the dissimilarities between
outputs of different tools and differences between outputs from
various iterations of the same method. We believe that further work
examining these differences and similarities will help us understand
the merits of these tools, uncover their possible shortcomings, and
help develop new methods.
<p><b><font color="red"> Point: Advocate the use of fully supervised
      automation to take advantage of larger and larger corpora.
      WordNet (and resources more generally) are mentioned only in
      passing.  Conclusion seems to be more about future work than the
      point.  (See comments about future work for the previous abstract.)

Determining the meanings of sentences can be accomplished using a
dictionary, which contains static definitions of potential
words. WordNet seeks to provide an alternative strategy to determine
meaning, where English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are
categorized by their synonyms and semantic relations connect synonym
sets (synsets). WordNet entries are stored as pairs of forms, or
strings of ASCII characters, and senses, or a synonym set. A "word" is
when a form has a sense in a given language. WordNet at this time
currently has over 118,000 unique forms, 90,000 unique senses, and
166,000 words. It also utilizes several semantic relations, including
synonymy (similar meaning), antonymy (opposite meaning), hyponymy and
hypernymy (hyponyms are "specific examples of" hypernyms), meronymy
and holonymy (meronyms are "part of" holonyms) to better understand
words. These relations are represented as pointers between synonym
nets or forms. Currently, WordNet struggles with polysemy. To combat
this problem, computational linguists attempt to limit the domain to
specific subject matter, like narrowing the domain to financial
institutions with the word "bank." Further work could be done to
improve this domain reduction process using artificial intelligence.

<p><b><font color="red">Point: Summary of WordNet.  The topic sentence
introduces dictionaries, which isn't exactly on point since WordNet is
more of an ontology than a dictionary.  Dictionaries are more about
definitions and examples, and less about relations among entries (such
as synonymy, antonymy, etc.)  The concluding sentence ought to ensure
that the reader remembers the point, but this concluding sentence
talks about further work using methods from another field.  While that
may or may not be a fair criticism of WordNet, if that was the point
of the abstract, the topic sentence should have introduced that point
with something like: It is possible to improve on WordNet by
introducing domain reduction processes from artificial intelligence.
But then the body of the abstract would be expected to back that point
up with some additional evidence, but the concluding sentence is
merely suggesting further work, which isn't enough to justify this
subject as the main point of the paper.
