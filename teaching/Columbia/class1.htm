    This class will be a combination of individual projects and a reading group but with an emphasis on presentation over content.

    <ol>
      <li>Projects start with a proposal, followed by negotiation ending with accepted proposals.  Mid-term exams will be replaced
	with progress reports.  Final exams will be replaced with project reports in three formats: (a) posters, (b) oral/video presentations and (c) written term papers.</li>
      <li>Readings will also emphasis presentation.
	The first public presentation that I gave was on my own research.  Many rock bands start out doing covers before
they write their own music.  So too, I believe students should start out presenting covers of seminal papers before
	presenting their own research.  There's lots of advice out there on public speaking such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY">Winston's Lecture on How to Speak</a>.</li>
    </ol>


    Grades will be based on projects (70%) and participation in class discussion (30%).  See discussion of projects <a href="#Projects">here</a>
    and readings <a href="#Readings">here</a>.

    <h2 id="#Readings">Readings</h2>

Each week we will discuss a few seminal papers
and their impact on the subsequent
literature.  Most of these papers will be at least a decade old, with at least 1k citations in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a>.
<p>
To encourage students to keep up with the reading, there will be an
assignment each week: imagine you are writing a survey paper on the
paper(s) assigned for that week and their impact on the subsequent
literature, including the literature of today. For the imaginary
survey paper, I want to see:
<ol>
  <li>An abstract of approximately 200 words outlining the argument in the imaginary paper.</li>
  <li>Citation counts for the assigned paper(s) (from Google Scholar).</li>
  <li>A partial bibliography of 10-30 references of papers that would
  be appropriate to discuss in the imaginary survey</li>
</ol>
Each week, a student will give a 30-minute presentation
on the reading for that week (and its implication for the contemporary
literature).  

I'd like to encourage students to practice presentation skills in a
supportive environment, so it isn't a good idea to grade presentations.
I want students to learn from one another's oral and written presentation.
Each week, I will post abstracts (without names) on the web with comments, so people can
see what works.

  <li><a href="http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf">The
    Structure of Scientific Revolutions</a>.  How does science (and
    engineering) progress?  Kuhn suggests the process has made
    significant progress over time (unlike <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/ldc/swung-too-far.pdf">
a pendulum swinging back
    and forth</a>), and that the progression is dramatic and far from
    incremental.  According
    to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions">Wikipedia</a>,
    Kuhn argues that the evolution of scientific theory does not
    emerge from the straightforward accumulation of facts, but rather
    from a set of changing intellectual circumstances and
    possibilities.  Kuhn dated the genesis of his book to 1947, when
    he was a graduate student at Harvard University and had been asked
    to teach a science class for humanities undergraduates with a
    focus on historical case studies. Kuhn later commented that until
    then, "I'd never read an old document in science." Aristotle's
    Physics was astonishingly unlike Isaac Newton's work in its
    concepts of matter and motion. Kuhn wrote "... as I was reading
    him, Aristotle appeared not only ignorant of mechanics, but a
    dreadfully bad physical scientist as well. About motion, in
    particular, his writings seemed to me full of egregious errors,
    both of logic and of observation." This was in an apparent
    contradiction with the fact that Aristotle was a brilliant
    mind. While perusing Aristotle's Physics, Kuhn formed the view
    that in order to properly appreciate Aristotle's reasoning, one
    must be aware of the scientific conventions of the time. Kuhn
    concluded that Aristotle's concepts were not "bad Newton," just
    different.</li>

    <li> Choose a project and write a proposal for what you plan to do.  First draft of the proposal is due 2nd week.  Revision is due 4th week.  Class time will be set aside during the 2nd and 3rd week for student presentations of their proposals.</li>
    <li> Mid-point check point.  Due 6th week.  Instead of a mid-term exam, we want to see signficant evidence of progress on the project, such as an MVP (minimal viable product).  Evidence can include
      a written document, demos, videos, etc.<li>
